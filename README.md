# Jane Eyre

This is [Charlotte BrontÃ«'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bront%C3%AB) [*Jane Eyre*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre) set in LuaTeX with digital tracings of [F.H. Townsend's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._H._Townsend) illustrations on a stock size of 215x135 mm. The source files have been manually converted from the public domain source provided by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260).

This version is intended to be set in [*Garamond Premier Pro*](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/garamond-premier) with layered initials in [*LTC Goudy Initials*,](https://www.p22.com/family-Goudy_Initials) with ornaments from [*Vectorian*](https://www.vectorian.net/), and with an additional title page and a cover. However, since these fonts and grapics require licenses, the version published here is instead set in *EB Garamond* without any additional ornaments.

The digital tracings have been created using [*potrace*](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) (with varying success).

Compile with `latexmk`.
