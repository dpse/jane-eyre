# Jane Eyre

This is Charlotte Bronte's *Jane Eyre* set in LuaTeX with digital tracings of F.H. Townsends illustrations on a stock size of 215x135 mm. The source files have been manually converted from the public domain source provided by Project Gutenberg.

The full version is set in *Garamond Premier Pro* with layered initials in *LTC Goudy* and with ornaments from *Vectorian*. It also includes an additional title page and a cover. Since these fonts and grapics require licenses, this version is instead set in *EB Garamond* without any additional ornaments.

The digital tracings have been created using *potrace*.
